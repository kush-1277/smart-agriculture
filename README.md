# smart-agriculture
A simple IoT project so as to demonstrate smart agriculture concept.

It is a simple code that is uploaded in Arduino Uno Board. The pin numbers can be seen in the code.

It takes data from the environment and sends it to the cloud to perform statistical analysis and show results.

The cloud tool used: Thingspeak.

The components used for the project: 
1. Arduino Uno Board 
2. ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module 
3. Air Quality Gas Sensor (MQ-135) 
4. Soil Moisture Sensor 
5. Temperature and Humidity Sensor(DHT11) 
6. Bread Board 
7. Wires and other basic Components

DHT11 Sensor's Library
Might need to install libraries first. If it doesn't work install a library of your choice and change the code accordingly.
